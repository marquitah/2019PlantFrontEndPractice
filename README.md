# 2019PlantFrontEndPractice

I believe it's incredibly important to learn new skills as well as sharpen existing ones. I am always on the lookout for beautiful features and functions, so I always take the time to check out the portfolios and projects of my peers and mentors. I gained wonderful inspiration from everyones work.

The main feature on this site that I wanted to learn how to do is the parallax scrolling effect. I think it's a great way to portray many different beautiful high resolution photos on one page. It's created with CSS styling effects.

Then, of course, I had to add some JavaScript functionality.

For the smooth scrolling navigation, I followed this tuturial which uses jQuery: https://byprimer.co/blog/navigation-smooth-scrolling-jquery/

I've used grids and cards in Bootstrap before but I think it's a very important front end solution to know how to do from scratch. I used a CSS grid container to display the photo gallery and it worked out pretty well!

For the JavaScript photo modal, I followed this tutorial: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp

Thanks for checking out my weekend side project!
